PLEASE NOTE: I am NO native English speaker. If you find any errors please let
             me know (e.g. by mail). Otherwise, my English is not getting better
             (as desired by myself). Thank you! -- Andreas Haerter

  * New config option: closed wiki
    If active, most tabs/boxes will be hidden until user is logged in.

  * Added Italian language files
    Thanks to Luigi Micco :-) (see CREDITS for details).

  * New config option: user pages
    You can (de)activate user pages now + choose a custom namespace for them.

  * Support for PNG favicons
    I do NOT recommend PNG for favicons (cause it is not supported by
    all browsers), but some users requested this feature. See README for
    details.

  * Fixed bug: "wrong link (double slash in front) when urlrewriteing is active"
    I replaced all "wl(getID())" with "wl(cleanID(getID())". Additionally, all
    "auth_quickaclcheck(trim($id, ":))" where replaced with
    "auth_quickaclcheck(cleanID($id))". See comment on
    <http://bugs.splitbrain.org/index.php?do=details&task_id=1983> for details.

  * Fixed bug: "wrong CSS within site wide notice"

  * Minor CSS improvements (screen and print layout)

  * Updated Brazilian Portuguese language files
    Thanks to Fabio Reis :-) (see CREDITS for details).
